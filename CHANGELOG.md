### 0.3.0

#### Added:
- **Out of Sight**
  
  A great performance-boosting mod, especially for multiplayer sessions!
  Short explaination: It renders tile-entities only in a specific range of blocks. You can configure the range to your needs and/or taste, as those entities might just **pop-in**. (*Pog*)
- **Path To Dirt**
  
  Come on... that was just missing.
- **Path Under Gates**
  
  Uhm.. that was missing too.
- **Polymorph**

  Until I customized most of the recipes on my own, this mod should do the trick!
- **Supplementaries**

  Just some stylish decoration. Verve *loves* decoration.

#### Updated:
- Better Animals Plus to 10.1.0
- BlockCarpentry to 0.8.2
- CC: Tweaked to 1.95.0
